# shouldideploytoday

This is a simple school project made with Next.js and Kitchen, which aims to help developers decide if they should deploy their code today or not. Thanks to the [Should I Deploy Today?](https://shouldideploy.today/) website for the inspiration and api.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
